## 2) Wrangling the Billboard Top 100

Popular music become increasingly diverse until the mid 70s, but drop
rapidly until the turn of the millenium. After that, the diversity of
music rises sharply through present day.

Elton John has the most number of ten-week hits with fifty two of them,
while most of the artists have less than forty.

## 3) Wrangling the Olympics

The average age of olympic swimmers spikes up in the 1910s and drops
dramatically in the 1920s and stays that way until it starts to steadily
rise in the 1970s. The trend looks similar for both female and male
swimmers but female swimmers started at a much lower average age when
they started competing. While the age gaps closed a bit, it’s mostly
always lower than the average male swimmer age.
